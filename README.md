# JavaScript 101 â€“ Learning Basics

This repository is created to start my JavaScript learning journey.

It will be used to follow and practice the concepts in the [30 Days Of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript) open source project.

My goal is to learn JavaScript fundamentals before moving on to React Native.
